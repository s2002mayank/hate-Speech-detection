# hate-Speech-detection
This repository contains code and resources for detecting hate speech in text data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can classify text as containing hate speech or not.

## Overview
Hate speech detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) aimed at identifying and mitigating harmful content online. This project involves preprocessing text data, feature extraction, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance in detecting hate speech.

## Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-detection?select=train.csv
This dataset, named hate_speech_offensive, is a meticulously curated collection of annotated tweets with the specific purpose of detecting hate speech and offensive language. The dataset primarily consists of English tweets and is designed to train machine learning models or algorithms in the task of hate speech detection. It should be noted that the dataset has not been divided into multiple subsets, and only the train split is currently available for use.

The dataset includes several columns that provide valuable information for understanding each tweet's classification. The column count represents the total number of annotations provided for each tweet, whereas hate_speech_count signifies how many annotations classified a particular tweet as hate speech. On the other hand, offensive_language_count indicates the number of annotations categorizing a tweet as containing offensive language. Additionally, neither_count denotes how many annotations identified a tweet as neither hate speech nor offensive language.

For researchers and developers aiming to create effective models or algorithms capable of detecting hate speech and offensive language on Twitter, this comprehensive dataset offers a rich resource for training and evaluation purposes
